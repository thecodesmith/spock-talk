Declaring Cardinality
```
1 * subscriber.receive("hello")      // exactly one call
0 * subscriber.receive("hello")      // zero calls
(1..3) * subscriber.receive("hello") // between one and three calls (inclusive)
(1.._) * subscriber.receive("hello") // at least one call
(_..3) * subscriber.receive("hello") // at most three calls
_ * subscriber.receive("hello")      // any number of calls, including zero
```
