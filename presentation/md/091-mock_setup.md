### Interaction-Based Testing
## Mocks and Stubs

```
class PublisherSpec extends Specification {
    Publisher publisher = new Publisher()
    Subscriber subscriber = Mock()
    Subscriber subscriber2 = Mock()

    def setup() {
        publisher.subscribers << subscriber // << is a Groovy shorthand for List.add()
        publisher.subscribers << subscriber2
    }
}
```
